👨‍🏫💥🥊👧 Playground Fight 👶💥🥊👩‍🏫

Inspired by a conversation I once overheard between a couple on a date.

'Oh, you teach Year 3? How many Year 3s do you reckon you could take?'

1 teacher can win a fight against up to 8 year three kids.

Each scenario will take in the number of teachers and the number of kids.

Your function will need to return the winners (either kids or teachers).

If there is no winner, return 'FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT'

If either the kids or teachers input is equal to 0, return "Nominate fighter"
